Follow these steps to create your PRD

1. Begin with a brief introduction stating the purpose of the document.

2. Organize your PRD into the following sections:
    ## Title and Overview
    ### 1.1 Document Title & Version
    ### 1.2 Product Summary
    ## 2. User Personas
    ### 2.1 Key User Types
    ### 2.2 Basic Persona Details
    ### 2.3 Role-based Access
        - Briefly describe each user role (e.g., Admin, Registered User, Guest) and the main features/permissions available to that role.
    ## 3. User Stories

3. For each section, provide detailed and relevant information based on the PRD instructions. Ensure that you:
    - Use clear and concise language

    - Maintain consistency throughout the document
    - Address all points mentioned in each section

4. When creating user stories and acceptance criteria:

    - Ensure no potential user interaction is omitted
    - Make sure each user story is testable

        - Title
        - Description
        - Acceptance Criteria
    </user_story>

5. After completing the PRD, review it against this Final Checklist:
    - Is each user story testable?
    - Are acceptance criteria clear and specific?
    - Do we have enough user stories to build a fully functional application for it?
    - Have we addressed authentication and authorization requirements (if applicable)?

6. Format your PRD:
    - Maintain consistent formatting and numbering.
    - Do NOT format text in markdown bold ** - we don't need this.
    - List ALL User Stories in the output!
    - Format the PRD in valid Markdown, with no extraneous disclaimers.
